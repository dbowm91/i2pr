# M6 Mixed-Router Interop Roadmap

Status: active

Long-term references:

- `GUARDRAILS.md` (non-negotiable security/architecture constraints)
- `specs/CONFORMANCE.md` (what counts as protocol-support evidence)
- `specs/support.toml` (machine-readable support inventory)

Research specs (dossier map: `specs/README.md`):

- `specs/protocols/02-i2np.md` (authenticated router-I2NP dispatch)
- `specs/SOURCES.md` + `specs/IMPLEMENTATIONS.md` (exact-pinned references: i2pd 2.61.0, Java I2P 2.13.0)

Related ADRs:

- `docs/adr/0021-minimal-java-support-topology.md`; see index for others.

## 1. Purpose and ownership boundary

Authenticated I2NP preflight, one-hop exploratory tunnels, NetDB lookup/publication, destination/garlic routing, short-build reply + NetDB reply-path + wire-format correctives, i2pd Streaming qualification (33/33), Java second-family qualification (controlled topology, pq tolerance, public-client observability, Branch G corrective framework, harness/evidence corrective).

Historic/registered plans: 183–194, 196–198, 200, 201, 205, 217–218 (global i2pr numbers, preserved).

## 2. Work classification

- **Capability** — the milestone-scoped user/operator-visible behavior each plan closes.
- **Infrastructure** — runtime-neutral crates, state machines, and harnesses underneath the capabilities.
- **Invariant** — bounded decodes, typed errors, loopback-by-default disclosure, fail-closed lanes.
- **Polish** — CI hygiene, docs normalization, and lane isolation passes.

## 3. Non-goals

- No `milestone6_interoperable` claim; Java second-family stays `not-yet-passed`. No public I2P, no reference patching, no production wire change to go green.

## 4. Current state

Plan 217 closed the Java closure harness and evidence corrective after Plan 216 exposed contradictions in the prior Java publication diagnosis. Plan 218 is dependency-ready; it owns the fresh exact-head external run on the corrected harness and the terminal `P200-*` classification flip. Plan 201 stays blocked until Plan 218 records that classification. Plan 205 is retained as a conditional SAM fallback only.

## 5. Target architecture

Retained historical subsystem: no new architecture is planned here. Changes require a new plan-of-record
in this subsystem, following `plans/README.md`.

## 6. Dependency graph

```text
183 -> 184 -> 185 -> 186 -> 187 -> 188 -> 190 -> 191 -> 192 -> 193 -> 196 -> 197 -> 194 -> 198 -> 200 -> 201 -> 217 -> 218. Plan 205 is a retained conditional fallback branch after Plan 218, not part of the primary sequence.
```

## 7. Milestones

One row per historic plan. `i2pr token` is the authoritative classification (newest status wins on
conflict); `state` is the codegg-registry projection. Filenames keep global i2pr numbers.

## 8. Cross-cutting requirements

Storage, protocol, security, concurrency, observability, and docs constraints per `GUARDRAILS.md`;
evidence model per `specs/CONFORMANCE.md`. Service/transport/API crates stay runtime-neutral;
`i2pr-runtime` owns Tokio/sockets/timers; listeners stay loopback-only and disabled by default.

## 9. Verification strategy

Routine floor plus `scripts/check-m6-mixed-router-acceptance-evidence.sh` (fail-closed; environment-gated).

Environment-gated lanes are `#[ignore]`-gated: ordinary runs skip them, explicit runs require
`--ignored --exact`, and missing env must fail, never silently pass.

Plan 217 added the `plan217_outbound_role_transfer_once_invariant`
unit row in `destination_tunnel_unit.rs` to lock the destination
driver's transfer-once property locally, and the corrected harness
exposes an `I2PR_M6_JAVA_DRIVER=destination|streaming|both` selector
(`run-java.sh`) so the destination and Streaming sub-runs can be
invoked independently during diagnosis without duplicating the
Java-router topology.

## 10. Risks and decision points

- Plan 217 closed the harness/evidence corrective; the prior Plan 216
  "no LS2 reply arrives" interpretation is no longer authoritative
  because the destination driver reached `LeaseStoreIngestOutcome::Completed`
  before the panic. Plan 218 must record a fresh terminal
  classification on the corrected harness before any downstream row
  can flip past blocked.
- Plan 205 SAM work is intentionally off the critical path; reactivate
  only if the corrected Plan 218 direct-I2CP qualification proves a
  genuine stock-Java boundary.

## 11. Completion definition

Open: Plan 218 performs final direct-I2CP Java second-family qualification
on the corrected harness. On Plan 218 success, M6 closes and Plan 204
becomes dependency-ready. On a genuine stock-Java direct-I2CP boundary,
Plan 218 may reactivate retained Plan 205.

## 12. Milestone status summary

Full row history is §7. Current authority: Plan 217 is closed
(harness/evidence corrective); Plan 218 is next executable; Plan 201
is blocked on Plan 218's fresh external classification; Plan 205 is
retained conditional fallback.
