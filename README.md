# i2pr

An experimental I2P router written in Rust. **Not production-ready.** Not suitable for anonymity, privacy, censorship resistance, or any security-sensitive workload. NTCP2 stays experimental and non-advertised.

## Status

The local Milestone 6 product (destinations, garlic, LeaseSet2, Streaming) remains closed under corrected local-correctness semantics via [**Plan 134**](plans/134-status.md). Independent-router interoperability is tracked as external acceptance debt. Milestone 7 / SAM is **not yet closed**. The I2P Base64 correction from Plan 142 is retained, and the Plan 143/144 local delivery plus in-process bidirectional Streaming handshake work is useful regression coverage, but post-audit evidence does not support the earlier broad private-destination/raw-STREAM closure claims: external `PRIV` compatibility still needs bidirectional reference proof; the daemon still lacks the dedicated TCP↔Streaming raw socket driver and bounded ACK/retransmit runtime ownership; and zero independent clients have yet moved application bytes through the real listener. [**Plan 145**](plans/145-status.md) is the current corrective authority, with execution sequence **146 → 147 → 148**. The `[sam]` config section remains disabled by default and loopback-only when enabled.
