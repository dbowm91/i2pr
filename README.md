# i2pr

An experimental I2P router written in Rust. **Not production-ready.** Not suitable for anonymity, privacy, censorship resistance, or any security-sensitive workload. NTCP2 stays experimental and non-advertised.

## Status

The local Milestone 6 product (destinations, garlic, LeaseSet2, Streaming) remains closed under corrected local-correctness semantics via [**Plan 134**](plans/134-status.md). Independent-router interoperability is tracked as external acceptance debt.

Milestone 7 / SAM has several strong retained results:

- [**Plan 146**](plans/146-status.md) passed bidirectional SAM 3.1 private-destination reference requalification against pinned Java I2P/i2pd behavior.
- [**Plan 147**](plans/147-status.md) landed the dedicated same-socket raw STREAM owner, TCP↔Streaming byte pump, actual Streaming `Established` wait, OS-CSPRNG runtime path, and supervised ACK/retransmit driver.
- [**Plan 149**](plans/149-status.md) passed the self-composing localhost STREAM product. `SESSION CREATE` now builds the destination/LeaseSet2/bridge/local-delivery/runtime-driver composition before returning success, and the canonical black-box test drives the resulting path only through SAM TCP after listener startup.
- [**Plan 150**](plans/150-status.md) retains successful external-client core evidence with exact pinned `i2psam` and qualified pinned `i2plib.sam` client surfaces: both cross-client 2 MiB directions, private destinations, SILENT, NAMING, negative inputs, and a positive loopback FORWARD trajectory passed. Its original broad final-closure interpretation was superseded after audit found required sibling-stream, slow-peer, fault, full FORWARD lifecycle, and focused M6 regression rows were not all executed by the closing harness.

[**Plan 151**](plans/151-m7-sam31-final-acceptance-evidence-correction.md) closed the Milestone 7 final acceptance: synthetic `passed` bookkeeping removed, executable sibling-stream/backpressure/fault/CLOSE-RESET/FORWARD lifecycle acceptance green, Plan 127–134 regression floor rerun, and the hosted external lane passed on the closing head (see [`plans/151-status.md`](plans/151-status.md) for the closure record).

[**Plan 152**](plans/152-m6-session-streaming-robustness-corrective.md) is the narrow Milestone 6 corrective Plan 151 §17 required (receiver retention cap with ACK gating, coalesced duplicate ACKs, sender ECIES ratchet-key trimming; no wire change). Fixes landed with unit tests; the full workspace floor was green on the Plan 151 closing head with routine CI and the hosted SAM external lane passing (see [`plans/151-status.md`](plans/151-status.md) and [`plans/152-status.md`](plans/152-status.md) for the closure records).

Current classification:

```text
plan_151 = passed-m7-sam31-final-acceptance-evidence-correction
plan_152 = passed-m6-session-streaming-robustness-corrective
plan_153 = active-post-m7-authority-and-ci-hygiene
milestone7_local_product = passed-via-plan149
plan150_external_core_evidence = retained-passed
milestone7_sam_localhost = passed-via-plan151
milestone7_final_acceptance = closed
milestone6_interoperable = not-yet-claimed
next_executable_plan = 153
next_product_layer = milestone8-ssu2-v2
```

Milestone 8 roadmap is registered via [**Plan 154**](plans/154-status.md) and blocked until Plan 153 passes; Milestone 8 implementation begins at Plan 155.

The `[sam]` config section remains disabled by default and loopback-only when enabled. No localhost SAM result is router-to-router interoperability evidence.
